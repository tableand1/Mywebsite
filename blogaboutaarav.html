            I love reading books. One of my favorite series is Percy Jackson.
            I love percy jackson because it always keeps you on your
            toes. It is about this kid named percy and he finds out that he 
            is the son of a greek god. He goes through many adventures over
            the course of 5 books.Even after this series, there is another great
            series after it which involves even more characters. it is called
            heroes of Oylumpus.

            Another series I like a lot is called Keeper of  the lost cities.
            It is about a elf called sophie. Who was raised among the humans.
            She has many powers which is very rare for the elfs. This series
            spans along 9 books with more being added. it is super intereing and 
            I have had so much fun reading this series.
