        I love movies. Today I am going to tell you some of my favorites.
        My favorite movie is avengers infinity wars.It has many interesting parts
        and is very good quality. I dont want to spoil the movie so I am not 
        going into any more details.

        I also like the harry potter movies. I love it because it is so interesting.
        The plotline is interesting and there are 7 movies so that the entertainment
        lasts for a long time.
